 Arrows @Cite { $hughes00.arrows } appeared in the general mindset as a pragmatic approach to deal with
 a certain class of parsers that did not fit into the monadic framework @Cite { $duponcheel96.parser }.
+While the analysis aspect (of the combined grammar) was one of the objectives, it happened at runtime
+on data propagated through the arrow. Our approach enables the analysis of the arrow itself.

 Nilsson @Cite { $nilsson05.frp } provides a method for optimizing limited cases of arrow combinator libraries using GADTs.
